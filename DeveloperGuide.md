## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

**THE PICTURE IS TO BE CHANGED BY UI TEAM**
<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. This model introduces a more streamlined structure where `AddressBook` holds a `TutorialList` and an `AssignmentList`, linking directly to `Tutorial` and `Assignment` entities. Each `Student` is associated with a `TutorialId`, and `Tutorial` entities maintain a list of `Student` objects, making it easier to manage relationships and reducing redundancy. This design allows `AddressBook` to manage tutorials and assignments without requiring each student to hold separate `Tutorial` or `Assignment` objects, simplifying interactions and data management.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, `TutorialStorage` and `AssignmentStorage`, which means it can be treated as one of these (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

The "Add Student" mechanism is facilitated by `Model` and `AddCommand`.
This feature enables users to seamlessly integrate new student profiles into TrackMate application. To ensure data integrity and completeness, the system necessitates the inclusion of essential parameters such as Name, Student ID, and optionally Tutorial ID.

#### Example Usage Scenario and Behavior at Each Step

Step 1: The user launches the application. The initial state contains no student data.

Step 2: The user executes an `add` command to add a new student. If the command format is correct, the system parses the command and creates a `Student` object.

Step 3: The system checks if the student already exists based on a unique identifier like student ID or email. If not, it commits the current state of the address book before adding the new student.

Step 4: The user receives feedback about the successful addition of the student.


#### Activity Diagram Explanation

Below is the activity diagram that outlines the user interactions and system processes involved in adding a new student profile. This diagram illustrates the step-by-step sequence required to successfully integrate a student into the TrackMate system.

<puml src="diagrams/AddFeatureActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram - Add"/>

#### Implementation - Class Diagram:

The class diagram below details the classes involved in the Add feature's implementation. It highlights the relationships and interactions between these classes, providing a clear view of the system's structure for adding a student.

<puml src="diagrams/AddFeatureClassDiagram.puml" alt="Class Diagram - Add"/>

**Key Components:**

- **AddCommandParser**: Interprets user input to create an appropriate `AddCommand`.
- **AddCommand**: Executes the operation to add a new student, producing a `CommandResult`.
- **ParserUtil**: Provides utility functions for parsing and validating various data types.
- **ArgumentMultimap**: Organizes command arguments for easy retrieval and processing.
- **Student**: The primary entity representing a student in the system.

#### Detailed Implementation Notes

- **ParserUtil Class**: Utilized for parsing string inputs into their respective data types and ensuring that inputs like names, student IDs, and tutorial IDs conform to expected formats. It automatically trims excessive whitespace.
- **ArgumentMultimap**: Facilitates the mapping of parsed arguments to their respective prefixes, ensuring organized and efficient data retrieval during command processing.
- **AddCommand**: Manages the creation of new student entries. It verifies the non-existence of duplicate student IDs and ensures the specified tutorial exists before adding the student to the model.

#### Design Considerations:

**Centralized Data Validation:**
- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Using a dedicated ParserUtil class for data validation centralizes validation logic, promoting modularity and maintainability.
    - **Pros**: Isolates validation logic, simplifying modifications and updates.
    - **Cons**: Adds a layer of abstraction, potentially increasing complexity.
- **Alternative 2**: Integrating validation functions directly within each class.
    - **Pros**: Enables context-specific validations tailored to specific needs.
    - **Cons**: Could lead to code duplication and maintenance challenges.

The chosen approach (Alternative 1) enhances code consistency and facilitates easier updates and maintenance by centralizing validation logic in the ParserUtil class. This method is especially effective given the similarity in validation requirements across different student attributes such as name, ID, and tutorial IDs.
